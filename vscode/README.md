# VSCode vs Atom
- better diff/path highlighting (not needed)
- missing plugin that highlights js the same way as atom-json-color or colorful-json (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31483)
- missing ability to open pdf files (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10821)
- ability to configure extension per language, i.e wordcount for .txt and .md (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26707)
- good wordcounter with scope detection that do not fuckup with mode name in vim mode
- highlight-collumn
- better todo lister

# Need to look for
- configure vim plugin
- configure full screen & all in vim
- update vim color mode bar
- find a way to have vim mode name smaller if possible
- vim mode better color changes for mode + mode on the right side of the bar
- internal terminal colors overwritten by theme
